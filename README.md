Programming samples in Pyhton and C++ for the tiscamera GStreamer modules.

### Snap an Image and Convert to OpenCV
[This](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/Linux-tiscamera-Programming-Samples/tree/master/Snap%20an%20Image%20and%20convert%20to%20OpenCV%20in%20Python#snap-an-image-and-convert-to-opencv) sample shows, how to snap an image from the video stream and make some OpenCV image processing on it. The result is displayed in an OpenCV window.

### Save an image on trigger in Python
This Python sample shows how to turn a camera into trigger mode for software trigger or hardware trigger and use a callback for receiving the triggered image. 

### Using Properties in C++
[This](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/Linux-tiscamera-Programming-Samples/tree/master/Using%20Properties%20in%20C%2B%2B#using-properties-in-c) example shows, how to use camera properties, here exposure and gain, in C++ using the [TcamCamera](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/tiscamera/tree/master/examples/cpp/common) class.

### Save an image using OpenCV in C++
[This](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/Linux-tiscamera-Programming-Samples/tree/master/Save%20an%20image%20using%20OpenCV%20in%20C%2B%2B) C++ sample shows how to capture images from the video stream, convert them to OpenCV cv::Mat and save them to hard disc.

### Stream over Network to VLC
[This](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/Linux-tiscamera-Programming-Samples/tree/master/Stream%20over%20Network%20to%20VLC#stream-over-network-to-vlc) article shows, how to setup a GStreamer pipeline for sending video stream to VLC over a network.
